<p>Born in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa. Lived there for 29 years before moving to Jeffreys bay the surfing capital of South
    Africa to open a hostel.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Backpacker was dedicated to my father that unexpectedly passed away in 2007, in a tragic motorcycle accident.</p>
<p>I met my wife in 2011 and we got married the same year. a Year later our first son was born and another two years later we had our
    second son.</p>
<p>2015, we decided to sell the backpackers and move back to Pretoria.</p>
<p>My wife never really got sold on "South Africa" as a place to live and raise our children. Well in all fairness with the crime rate
    being in the world top 5 and an unemployment rate of 26.55% in 2016, I couldn't disagree.</p>
<p>So in early 2017, we decided to pack our bags and head for New Zealand. It was a difficult decision for me to make, leaving all my
    family and friends behind, but at the same time an extremely easy one knowing I will be giving my sons great opportunities in life.
</p>
<p>I'm currently {{ 'now'  | date: "%Y" | minus : 1981}}, and living happely in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy taking on any DIY project, automating my house, tinker with electronics or get involved with a programming project.</p>
